# Linux Device Drivers Practice

This repository contains Linux device driver source code and practice exercises developed to gain hands-on experience with Linux kernel programming and embedded Linux systems.

## 📌 Purpose  
The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in **Linux device driver development** and **kernel internals**, with a focus on low-level, system-oriented programming for embedded platforms.

This work supports preparation for roles in:
- Embedded Software Development  
- Embedded Linux and BSP Development  
- Linux Device Driver Engineering  

## 📂 Topics Covered  
- Linux Kernel Modules and module programming  
- Character device drivers  
- Kernel internals:
  - Dynamic memory allocation  
  - Handling delays and kernel timers  
  - Synchronization and locking mechanisms  
- Interrupt handling and deferred execution  
- I/O memory mapping and port I/O  
- Driver debugging techniques  
- Drivers for hardware interfaces:
  - GPIO  
  - I2C  
  - SPI  
- Pseudo filesystems:
  - procfs  
  - sysfs  

## 📈 Learning Outcome
-By working through this repository, you will gain:
-Strong understanding of Linux kernel internals
-Confidence in writing and debugging device drivers
-Practical exposure required for Embedded Linux and Driver development roles
-A solid foundation for kernel, and low-level system programming

## 🛠 Platform  
- Embedded Linux  
- Practice on platforms such as BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi, and QEMU (as applicable) 

## ⚠️  Note
This repository is strictly for **learning and practice purposes**.  
Executable files and build artifacts are excluded using `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean and professional.</br></br>
